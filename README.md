# CS-370

#Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The project involved implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm using neural networks to solve a pathfinding problem represented by a maze game. The initial code provided to me was a partially implemented Python script containing the necessary classes and methods for creating the game environment and defining the behavior of the pirate agent in the game. I was then required to write additional code to complete the implementation of the deep Q-learning algorithm, which involved creating a neural network model to predict the Q-values of the possible actions at each state, implementing the experience replay buffer to store and replay the agent's experiences, and writing the training loop to train the model on the experiences in the replay buffer.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are experts who design and develop software and hardware systems to solve real-world problems. They use computational techniques and mathematical algorithms to analyze, process, and store data, and create complex systems that can automate tasks, make predictions, and improve decision-making. Their work impacts every aspect of modern society, from business and finance to healthcare, transportation, and communication. In today's digital world, computer scientists play a critical role in driving innovation, improving efficiency, and addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I can approach a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems and analyzing each one separately. I can use logical and mathematical reasoning to design algorithms that can solve these sub-problems. Once I have designed an algorithm, I can implement it using a programming language and test it on sample data. Finally, I can refine the algorithm and improve its efficiency by analyzing its time and space complexity. This iterative approach allows computer scientists to solve complex problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces and designing efficient algorithms to solve them.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization I are working for are These responsibilities ensuring that the products I develop are safe and secure, protecting user privacy, and avoiding bias and discrimination in my work. I should also consider the potential impact of my work on society and the environment, and work to mitigate any negative effects. Additionally, I should always be transparent about the limitations of my products and be honest with users and stakeholders about any risks or potential problems.
